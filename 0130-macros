MACROS
------

Macros are just a series of keystrokes saved in a register.

    q{a-z} (start recording macro into register {a-z})
    q      (stop recording macro)
    @{a-z} (run macro in register {a-z})
    @@     (run most recently-run macro)

Macros can be recursive!

If autoformatting causes a line to wrap while recording a macro, disable by
using

    :set paste
